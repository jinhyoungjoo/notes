# Computer Graphics Pipeline

## 0. Resources (Input)
- Triangles and textures are fed into the graphics pipeline.

## 1. Input Assembler
- Identify each vertices' components (e.g. what each values are or data types).

## 2. Vertex Shader
- Transform the vertices into a useable format.
- Positions are ranged inside -1 and 1.

## 3. Tesselation
- Transform low polygon models to higher polygon models by adding more primitives.

## 4. Geometry Shader
- Add more geometry.

## 5. Rasterizer
- Transform the input primitives to a grid of pixels and a z-buffer.

## 6. Pixel Shader
- Calculate Color

## 7. Output Merger
