# C Keywords

## Static
- The static keyword affects the scope.
- A static global variable or a static function makes it only visible within its own translation unit.
- A static local variable makes it persistent across function calls, but makes it only visible within its function.
- Static can be used to make a variable persistent, or make more modular code.
