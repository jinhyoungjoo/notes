# OSI Layer 7 Application Layer

- Network applications do not care about the network architecture and instead focuses on the application architecture.
- Network applications will most likely be either in a client-server architecture or a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture.
- Two processes each running on different end systems communicate by exchanging messages across the computer network.

## Sockets
- A process can send/recieve messages in a network from a software interface called a socket.
- This is referred to as the API (Application Programming Interface) between the application layer and transport layer.
- A process is identified by its host (IP address) and a destination port number.
