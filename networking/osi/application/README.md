# Application Layer

## Application Layer Protocols
- An application-layer protocol defines how two processes on different end systems pass messages to each other.
- Application-layer protocols do not need to care about the underlying network architecture.

## Sockets
- A process can send/recieve messages in a network from a software interface called a socket.
- This is referred to as the API (Application Programming Interface) between the application layer and transport layer.
- A process is identified by its host (IP address) and a destination port number.
